while let variable cannot be reassigned and it has code block scope.

// What is the difference between var and const?

/* var variable can be redeclared and reassigned while const variable can nether be redeclred 
nor reassigned and has code block scope.

//What is the difference between let and const ?
/* let variable can be reassigned while const cannot be reassigned. */

// What is hoisting?
// When var variable declaration is moved at the top of the code compilation however its value remains undefined until value
// is assigned. This is not the case in the let and const variable declaration. function declaration are also hoisted before defining in the 
// codebase.
